                    conditions applied during the transactions. So, as you have selected your product, you have

                <h6>A customer can place a request for Return/Cancellation if:</h6>
                <p>During the course of the transaction of a certain product, the product suffers a certain form of
                    damage.
                    During the course of the process of manufacture, the product suffers a defect.</p>
                <p>The customer discovers that the product is not as per the description as seen on the website.
                    The order placed has been suffering a delay of over 10 days.
                    The items purchased from the website www. Brand Beans.com can be returned well within 15 days of the
                    purchase date.
                    It is mandatory to ensure on the customer’s part to sustain the tags, packaging and the original
                    condition of the product purchased, in case you are considering a return of the same.</p>
                <h6>A customer shopping at <a href="http://brandbeans.biz/">www.brandbeans.com</a> need to bear in mind
                    that a product cannot be canceled or
                    returned if:
                </h6>
                <p>The product cannot be considered for a return or cancellation if the 15-day return window has been
                    crossed. The product will not be returned or considered for a cancellation if it has been damaged
                    after delivery, in case of missing tags or missing packaging. The customer should bear in mind that
                    a product cannot be canceled if it has been shipped once.</p>

                <h6>When can a customer get the Refund they are entitled to?</h6>
                <p>All the customers shopping at Brand Beans must bear in mind that the process of REFUND will be
                    initiated from
                    our end only after the concerned product has reached us in the expected condition. This might
                    explain the
                    variation in the time taken for a refund to be processed as this directly depends upon the
                    efficiency of our
                    courier partners to ensure the on-time delivery of the concerned product to our warehouses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, technically it takes a maximum of 5 – 14 business days for the process of REFUND to be
                    initiated from our end. The customers can be rest assured that they will be notified of the same
                    through Emails.
                </p>
                <h6>Other Factors to Bear in Mind</h6>
                <p>
                    The RETURN services at Brand Beans are FREE when utilizing the prepaid, the printed courier label
                    which can be easily found on the packaging of the concerned product intended for return or/and when
                    utilizing the retreat service through the courier. However, if in case a customer opts for an
                    alternative courier service due to a certain circumstance, the customer will have to bear the cost
                    of the return shipment by themselves.
                </p>
                <p>The request for RETURNS will only be accepted from the country that the original order has been
                    placed. We at Brand Beans do not entertain returns from a country that is different from the country
                    the order was initially placed at.</p>
                <p>
                    It is important for the customers to bear in mind that all the terms and conditions of the Return
                    and Cancellation policies need to be respected accordingly. In case an item included originally is
                    found to be missing, or incomplete, in such a case the return request will be dutifully canceled. We
                    are entitled to refuse the customs documentation and it will be returned to the Shipper.
                    It is important to bear in mind that in case of a Credit Card refund, it might take up to 10 days to
                    process.
